Calon Arang was a widow who lived in the village of Girah with her daughter Manggali. She was a powerful sorceress who mastered the dark arts of black magic. She was also very angry and vengeful, because no one wanted to marry her daughter due to her reputation. She blamed the king of Bali, Erlangga, for not finding a suitable husband for Manggali.
 
She decided to take revenge on the king and his people by spreading a deadly plague that killed many people and animals. She also created a book of spells that contained her secrets of black magic. She hid the book in a cemetery, where she often performed her rituals with her followers.
 
The king was desperate to stop the plague and sought the help of a holy man named Empu Baradah. Empu Baradah agreed to help the king, but he needed a disciple who could face Calon Arang and her magic. He chose his son, Empu Bahula, who was brave and skilled in martial arts.
 
Empu Bahula disguised himself as a wandering monk and went to Girah. He met Manggali and fell in love with her. He asked Calon Arang for her permission to marry Manggali, and she agreed, hoping that this would end her curse. However, Empu Bahula had another plan. He secretly stole Calon Arang's book of spells and brought it to his father.
 
Empu Baradah studied the book and found a way to reverse Calon Arang's magic. He also discovered that Calon Arang had made a pact with the goddess Durga, who gave her power in exchange for human sacrifices. Empu Baradah decided to challenge Calon Arang to a duel of magic at the cemetery.
 
On the night of the full moon, Empu Baradah and Empu Bahula faced Calon Arang and her followers at the cemetery. They engaged in a fierce battle of spells and weapons. Empu Baradah used his knowledge of Calon Arang's book to counter her attacks. He also invoked the power of Shiva, the supreme god, to overcome Durga's influence.
 
Calon Arang realized that she was losing and tried to escape. But Empu Bahula chased her and killed her with his dagger. He then burned her body along with her book of spells. As Calon Arang died, she cursed Empu Bahula for betraying her and Manggali for being unfaithful.
 
The death of Calon Arang ended the plague and restored peace and prosperity to Bali. The king thanked Empu Baradah and Empu Bahula for their service and rewarded them with honors and lands. Manggali was heartbroken by the death of her mother and her lover. She decided to follow them in death by throwing herself into the fire.
 
However, their story did not end there. According to some versions of the legend, Shiva was impressed by Calon Arang's power and devotion to Durga. He resurrected her and made her his consort. He also resurrected Manggali and Empu Bahula and reunited them as lovers. He gave them a place in his heaven, where they lived happily ever after.
