## What is Alias Surface?
 
Alias Surface is a software application that allows you to create and edit 3D surfaces using NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) technology. NURBS are mathematical curves that can represent any shape, from simple lines and circles to complex organic forms. NURBS surfaces are ideal for industrial design because they can be easily modified, blended, trimmed, and filleted to create smooth and seamless transitions between different shapes.

Alias Surface is part of the Autodesk Alias family of products, which also includes Alias AutoStudio, Alias Concept, Alias SpeedForm, and Alias Design. These products share a common interface and workflow, but have different features and capabilities depending on the specific needs of the user. Alias Surface is the most advanced and versatile product in the family, as it allows you to create and edit any type of surface, from simple planes and cylinders to complex freeform shapes.
 
## What's New in Alias Surface 2019?
 
Alias Surface 2019 introduces many new features and enhancements that improve the user experience and productivity. Some of the highlights include:
 
- **New Subdivision Modeling Tools:** You can now create and edit subdivision surfaces in Alias Surface 2019. Subdivision surfaces are polygonal meshes that can be subdivided into finer levels of detail, resulting in smooth and organic shapes. You can convert subdivision surfaces to NURBS surfaces or vice versa, or use them together in a hybrid modeling approach.
- **New Sketching Tools:** You can now sketch directly on your 3D model using a stylus or mouse. You can use sketching tools such as pencils, markers, brushes, erasers, and smudges to create curves, lines, shapes, and textures on your surface. You can also use sketching tools to modify existing curves and surfaces by pushing, pulling, smoothing, or sculpting them.
- **New Rendering Engine:** Alias Surface 2019 uses a new rendering engine based on Autodesk Raytracer (ART), which provides faster and more realistic rendering results. You can preview your model in real time with shadows, reflections, materials, and lighting effects. You can also export your model to other Autodesk products such as VRED or Maya for further rendering and animation.
- **New Data Exchange Formats:** You can now import and export your models in more formats than before. Alias Surface 2019 supports formats such as OBJ, STL, FBX, IGES, STEP, JT, CATIA V5/V6, SolidWorks, NX, Creo Parametric, Inventor, Rhino, SketchUp, Revit, Fusion 360, and more. This allows you to easily share your models with other software applications or collaborators.

## Why Choose Alias Surface 2019?
 
Alias Surface 2019 is a powerful tool for industrial designers who need to create and edit complex 3D surfaces. It offers many advantages over other software applications such as:

- **Flexibility:** You can create any type of surface you want using NURBS or subdivision modeling techniques. You can also combine different types of surfaces in a hybrid modeling approach. You have full control over the shape and quality of your surface.
- **Precision:** You can create accurate and realistic models of your products using advanced tools such as curve continuity analysis, surface evaluation tools, curvature combs, draft angles analysis, surface alignment tools, etc. You can also use parametric modeling tools such as history tracking, expressions, variables, constraints, etc. to define relationships between different parts of your model.
- **Creativity:** You can unleash your creativity using sketching tools that allow you to draw directly on your model. You can also use sculpting tools that let you modify 8cf37b1e13
