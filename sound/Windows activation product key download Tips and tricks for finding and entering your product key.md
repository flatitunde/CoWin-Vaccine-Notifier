# How to Activate Windows with a Product Key
 
If you want to use Windows on your device, you need to activate it with a product key. A product key is a 25-character code that verifies that your copy of Windows is genuine and not used on more devices than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow. In this article, we will show you how to find your product key and how to use it to activate Windows.

- If you bought a new PC running Windows, the product key should be preinstalled on your device and included in the box or in the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker on the device.
- If you bought a copy of Windows from an authorized retailer, the product key should be on a label or card inside the box.
- If you bought a digital copy of Windows from an authorized retailer, the product key should be in the confirmation email you received after buying it.
- If you bought a digital copy of Windows from a Microsoft website, the product key should be in the confirmation email you received after buying it or in your Microsoft account under Digital Content.
- If you upgraded to Windows 10 or Windows 11 for free from an eligible device running a genuine copy of Windows 7, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, you don't need a product key. You have a digital license that automatically activates Windows when you sign in with your Microsoft account.

## How to Activate Windows with a Product Key
 
Once you have your product key, you can use it to activate Windows on your device. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Make sure your device is connected to the internet.
2. Select the Start button and then select Settings > System > Activation.
3. Select Change product key and enter your 25-character product key.
4. Select Next to start the activation process.
5. If you see a message that says Activation successful, you're done. If you see an error message, try troubleshooting the problem or contact Microsoft support for help.
