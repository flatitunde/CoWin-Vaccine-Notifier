## DC Circuits
 
A DC circuit is a circuit that consists of a source of direct current (DC) and one or more resistors, capacitors, inductors, or other electrical components connected in series or parallel. The main parameters of a DC circuit are voltage, current, resistance, power, and energy. The voltage is the potential difference between two points in a circuit and is measured in volts (V). The current is the rate of flow of electric charge through a circuit and is measured in amperes (A). The resistance is the opposition to the flow of current through a circuit and is measured in ohms (Î©). The power is the rate of doing work or transferring energy in a circuit and is measured in watts (W). The energy is the capacity to do work or transfer heat in a circuit and is measured in joules (J) or watt-hours (Wh).
 
The basic laws that govern the behavior of DC circuits are Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's current law, Kirchhoff's voltage law, and Joule's law. Ohm's law states that the voltage across a resistor is directly proportional to the current through it. Kirchhoff's current law states that the algebraic sum of currents at any node (junction) in a circuit is zero. Kirchhoff's voltage law states that the algebraic sum of voltages around any closed loop in a circuit is zero. Joule's law states that the power dissipated by a resistor is equal to the product of the current through it and the voltage across it.
 
Some examples of DC circuits are batteries, LED lights, solar panels, electric motors, and electronic devices. DC circuits are used for applications that require constant and stable voltage and current sources, such as digital logic circuits, communication systems, and control systems.
 
## AC Circuits
 
An AC circuit is a circuit that consists of a source of alternating current (AC) and one or more resistors, capacitors, inductors, or other electrical components connected in series or parallel. The main parameters of an AC circuit are voltage, current, impedance, power factor, apparent power, real power, and reactive power. The voltage and current in an AC circuit vary sinusoidally with time and have a frequency and a phase angle. The frequency is the number of cycles per second and is measured in hertz (Hz). The phase angle is the angle between the voltage and current waveforms at any point in time and is measured in degrees (Â°) or radians (rad). The impedance is the opposition to the flow of AC current through a circuit and is measured in ohms (Î©). The impedance consists of two components: resistance and reactance. The resistance is the same as in DC circuits and represents the energy dissipation by heat. The reactance is due to the presence of capacitors or inductors in the circuit and represents the energy storage by electric or magnetic fields. The reactance can be either positive or negative depending on whether the component causes a lagging or leading phase angle.
 
The power factor is the ratio of real power to apparent power in an AC circuit and indicates how efficiently the circuit uses the supplied power. The apparent power is the product of the RMS values of voltage and current and is measured in volt-amperes (VA). The real power is the average power delivered to or consumed by the resistive components in the circuit and is measured in watts (W). The reactive power is the average power delivered to or consumed by the reactive components in the circuit and is measured in volt-amperes reactive (VAR). The apparent power can be calculated from the real power and reactive power using Pythagoras' theorem: S^2 = P^2 + Q^2
 
Some examples of AC circuits are generators, transformers, electric lamps, fans, air conditioners, and power grids. AC circuits are used for applications that require varying voltage and current sources, such as lighting systems, heating systems, motor drives, and transmission systems.
