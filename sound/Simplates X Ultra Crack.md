If you are a serious flight simulation enthusiast, you know how important it is to have realistic and accurate IFR plates for your virtual flights. IFR plates are the charts that pilots use to fly instrument approaches, departures, and arrivals in real-world aviation. They contain vital information such as runway layouts, frequencies, altitudes, headings, and procedures that help pilots navigate safely and efficiently in various weather conditions.
  
But where can you find IFR plates for your flight simulator? You could try to search online for free or paid sources, but you would soon discover that most of them are either outdated, incomplete, low-quality, or hard to access. You would also have to deal with different formats, standards, and languages for different countries and regions. And you would have to constantly update your collection as new plates are issued or old ones are revised.

SimPlates X Ultra is compatible with any flight simulator that supports instrument flying, such as Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, X-Plane, Prepar3D, FSX, FS2004, and more. You can use SimPlates X Ultra as a standalone app or alongside your simulator. You can print the plates or view them on your device as real pilots do more and more.
  
SimPlates X Ultra is not a flight simulator itself, nor does it provide any navigation or guidance functions. It is a collection of plates and a directory that you can use as a reference for your simulated flights. However, pilots, please avoid all temptation and do not use SimPlates X Ultra for real-world flight. This is because actual IFR plates have relatively short life spans, and thus the plates in SimPlates X Ultra should be considered expired. However, they are still more than perfectly valid for simulator flying.
